        <h2>About</h2>
        <h4><p>The digital divide is a term that refers to the gap between demographics and regions that have access to modern information and communications technology (ICT), and those that don't or have access. 
        This technology can include the telephone, television, personal computers and internet connectivity. At decreasing the gap in Digital Divide, the mission is to raise awareness about the digital divide and its impact on society. I believe that everyone should have equal access to technology and its benefits, 
        regardless of their socioeconomic status. Digital divides exist between developed and developing countries, urban and rural populations, young and educated versus older and less educated individuals, and men and women.</p>
